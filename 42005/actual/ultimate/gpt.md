#	GPT's Answer
There's a lot of ambition here—and plenty of room for improvement. I went through the code carefully with your priorities in mind. Here are some observations and suggestions organized by the issues you flagged:

---

### 1. Redundancies and Optimizations (Low Priority)

<!-- LOW PRIORITY -->
- **Repeated logic for argument parsing:**  
  You’re scanning the strings in [arg_check()](execute.c#L252) and then later in [arg_to_arr()](execute.c#L278). Rather than duplicating the tokenizing logic, **consider creating a helper** that *tokenizes a string into numbers*. You might build a temporary array (or process on the fly) so that you don’t have to “count” and then re-parse everything. That can both simplify and consolidate your error-checking in one place.
<!-- FIXED -->
- **Repeated arithmetic and pointer expressions:**  
  Many places use expressions like `malloc(sizeof(int) * arr[0] + 1)`. Note that due to operator precedence, this allocates `sizeof(int) * arr[0]` bytes plus one extra byte. You probably want `malloc(sizeof(int) * (arr[0] + 1))` so that you allocate space for one extra int. This applies to all similar allocations.
<!-- promising -->
- **Similar operations for push, swap, rotate:**  
  The structure of your push/swap functions is largely similar. Once the core behavior is proven correct, a layer of helper functions could isolate common operations, reducing repetition.  
  *(For instance, you can write a helper for “rotate” that works on a given array pointer and then call it for both A and B.)*

### 2. Logical Breaches (High Priority)

from
[TODO: FIND CALLER]()
<!-- CRITICAL! TODO -->
- **Array indexing and off-by-one hazards:**  
  In several loops you use index conditions like `while (++i < arr[0])` or similar. Make sure you’re always aware that you’re using index 0 as a counter (e.g., storing the total count) and that the array elements begin at index 1. There’s a risk you may be skipping the first element or accessing a non-existent element. For example, in `arr_to_stk()`, you loop with  
  ```c
  while (i <= argn[0])
  {
      n = 0;
      while (n++ < argn[j])
      {
          num = arg_to_int(argv[j], n);
          // ...
          arr[i++] = (int)num;
      }
      j++;
  }
  ```  
<!-- promising, comments are allowed -->
  Revisit this logic carefully. Consider adding comments that explain what each index represents; sometimes renaming variables (like `total_args` instead of `arr[0]`) can help.


<!-- fixed -->
- **Initialization of loop counters and variables:**  
  In `sort_three()`, the variable `i` is declared but never initialized before you use it to iterate through your `ops` array. This can lead to undefined behavior. Initialize it to 0 before the loop (e.g., `i = 0;`).
<!-- promising -->
- **Cost calculation in [check_sort_a()](execute.c#L476) and [check_sort_b()](execute.c#L510):**  
  You’re using a variable (`gd`) to determine the “greatest distance,” but in `check_sort_a()` it isn’t explicitly initialized before being used in a comparison (`if (i == 1 || a[i] - n > gd) gd = ...`). Uninitialized variables can yield unpredictable behavior. Initialize such variables with a proper starting value (e.g., `gd = 0;` or use an appropriate first valid difference).
<!-- promising, look into -->
- **Operator precedence pitfalls:**  
  In the [ft_put_struct()](execute.c#L1088) function, the loop condition  
  ```c
  while (++i && i <= s->a[0] || i <= s->b[0])
  ```  
  is hard to read and may not work as intended due to the precedence of `&&` vs. `||`. Group with parentheses to clarify what you really mean, for example:  
  ```c
  while (++i && (i <= s->a[0] || i <= s->b[0]))
  ```
  or consider splitting the condition into two separate loops for clarity.
<!-- IN PROGRESS -->
- **Ambiguous error-handling:**  
  In functions like [error_end_stk()](execute.c#L1088), you free the structure pointer but **don’t free any dynamically allocated fields** (like `s->a`, `s->b`, etc.). If you call an error routine, you’d typically want to free everything you allocated. A dedicated cleanup function would be useful.

---

### 3. Memory Leaks and Issues (High Priority)
<!-- FIXED (mostly?) -->
- **Allocation with incorrect grouping:**  
  As mentioned, every allocation like  
  ```c
  s->a = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int) * arr[0] + 1);
  ```  
  likely doesn’t allocate enough memory. Use:  
  ```c
  s->a = malloc(sizeof(int) * (arr[0] + 1));
  ```  
  This applies to all similar allocations and prevents potential memory overwrites.
<!-- IN PROGRESS -->
- **Checking for allocation failures:**  
  You’re checking if each allocation returns NULL, which is good. However, in the event of an error (see `error_end_stk()`), the code sometimes frees only the pointer passed (or nothing at all) and then immediately exits. It might be worth building a centralized cleanup routine that frees all allocated parts of your `t_stk` structure, including `s->a`, `s->b`, etc., to avoid memory leaks if that code ever evolves into a long-running process.
<!-- CRITICAL! TODO! -->
- **Double-free issues:**  
  Some functions free the argument array (e.g., in [arr_normalizer()](execute.c#L382), you call `free(arr)`), but then you call `error_end_arr(arr)` in error conditions. Make sure *once freed that pointer isn’t used again.*
<!-- CRITICAL! TODO! -->
- **Leak on early error returns:**  
  In `main()`, if [arg_duplicate(arr)](execute.c#L360) fails, you call `error_end_arr(arr)`, but if there were other allocations or if `nexus` was partially allocated, those won’t get freed. Depending on your design, **you may consider a “cleanup” function** that frees all allocated resources before exit.

---

### 4. Mistakes You Can't See (High Priority)
<!-- CRITICAL! TODO! -->
- **Undefined behavior due to uninitialized variables:**  
  As noted, variables like `i` in `sort_three()` and `gd` in the sort-check functions need initialization. In C, not initializing local variables can lead to subtle bugs.
<!-- look into this -->
- **Mixing signed/unsigned:**  
  Using `size_t` for sizes (like `s->size`) is good; however, many parts of your code mix `int` and `size_t` (for example, loops in `push_a()` and `rotate_a()`). This can cause signed/unsigned mismatches and compiler warnings. Standardize on one type for indices if possible.
<!-- FIXED (mostly?) -->
- **Improper use of operator precedence in conditions:**  
  As mentioned in the utility functions and loop conditions, the lack of parentheses could be causing logic errors that are hard to spot.
<!-- promising, see next -->
- **Parsing logic ambiguity:**  
  The function `arg_to_int()` uses `argn` as a countdown. The logic inside that loop is hard to follow—for example, you have:
  ```c
  while (argn && arg[i])
  {
      c = arg[i++];
      if ((c >= '0' && c <= '9') && argn == 1)
      {
          num *= 10;
          num += c - '0';
      }
      if (argn == 1 && c == '-')
          mag *= -1;
      else if ((c >= '0' && c <= '9') && (arg[i] == ' ' || arg[i] == '\0'))
          argn--;
  }
  ```
<!-- promising: try first, then ask for help!
TOKENIZING ARGS
-->
  It isn’t clear what happens if there are multiple numbers in one string. If each number is separated by spaces, you might want to split the string into tokens first (using a function you write or even something like `strtok`, if allowed) and then **parse each token into a number**. This reduces the chance of misreading a boundary condition.
<!-- more about: "conditional on a correct state":
OK	-	write (1, "sth", 3);//	<-- this is usually safe
KO	-	write (1, ptr, strlen(ptr));//	<-- this has perils
-->
- **Mixing printing and logic:**  
  There are plenty of direct calls to `write()` for commands like "pa\n", "sa\n", etc. These side-effects can hide logical errors if the write isn’t *conditional on a correct state*. **Keep your sorting logic separate from logging** if possible to debug more easily.

### Final Thoughts

Refactoring something as complex as your push_swap is always a balancing act between clarity, efficiency, and maintaining the required behavior (especially under the constraints from 42). One strategy that may help is:
<!-- IN PROGRESS -->
1. **Modularize:**  
   Separate argument parsing, memory allocation, sorting logic, and cleanup into clearly delineated modules.  
<!-- promising -->
2. **Write Unit Tests:**  
   For key functions (like your normalization, cost calculation, and push/swap operations) write small test cases. That helps illuminate edge cases and confirm behavior as you refactor.  
<!-- IN PROGRESS -->
3. **Systematic Cleanup:**  
   Create a cleanup function that walks through your `t_stk` structure freeing each allocated field if an error occurs.

The code is a vibrant tapestry of ideas. With some extra care on initialization, allocation grouping, and error handling, you'll have a robust solution ready to run through its paces.
