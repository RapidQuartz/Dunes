###	OPEN TASKS:
[-13:02:15-](../actual/push_swap.c#push_b)
need to think about WHEN to 'make new stack'
by this logic i am seemingly not passing jack...
stack B could just be like... ONE node.
so in push b for instance, i could simply set the next-pointers
so that stack b is like... the node that was pushed.
and the next node in A is fine anyway right.
i just have to return that "a no longer contains the node that was set"
but its not that simple... 
aagh. time for a break right.
###	CLOSED TASKS:
[-11:03:47-](../actual/arr.c#normalizer)
change from `stack/snap` - logic to `int array` logic
issue:	does not 'skip' already filled values, because it only deals with ONE array
prob need another array?
