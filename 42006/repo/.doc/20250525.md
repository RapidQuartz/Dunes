##	TODO:

before handing it in:
- easy:
	- [ ] git clone the `mlx` library when compiling  
	(to avoid illegal files in repository when uploading)
- medium:
	- [ ] norminate it
	- [ ] develop a better `exit` strategy.
	{look up the following tag: `//TODO:integrate into exit function`}
- hard:
	- [ ] [draw something](drawing.md#index)
	- [ ] make sure everything runs smoothly without leaks
