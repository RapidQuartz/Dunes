##	notes  
just got started. it's already 13:09. slightly feeling the Fear  
as my deadline approaches. it is what it is.  

at any rate, today i will also work for a while.  
later, i will go put away my luggage, or i might postpone it tbh.  
depends on my flow i guess. i have about five hours until then.  
could be five effective hours if i have a bit of discipline.  
more oil.
